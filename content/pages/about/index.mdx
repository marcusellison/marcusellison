I grew up poor in a small town on the coast of Maine.

My life changed when I went to college at New York University.

I met people that inspired me to dream and act bigger than I thought possible.

My professional network changed my life. 

I believe your network is your tribe. It defines who you are and what you can become.

Yet it has been impossible for me to nurture relationships with all the wonderful people that I want to keep in my life.

My mission is to improve communication in business networks. 

This is why I'm building breadcrumb.so - to make it easier to communicate with your business network and understand what's happening.



I spend a lot of time thinking about:
- Authentic interactions
- Identity and reputation
- Decentralized governance
- Deconstructing and reconstructing information
