I grew up poor in Maine.

Each day is an opportunity to discover what's possible.

I'm motivated by impact, by the journey of doing, and the pursuit of what matters.

I'm building - [breadcrumb](https://breadcrumb.ai) to make information visual.

I spend a lot of time thinking about:
- Authentic interacting
- Identity and reputation
- Deconstructing and reconstructing information
