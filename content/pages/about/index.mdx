Intentional designer. Unintentional coder.

I'm on a journey. I am searching for fundamental truths that can help me understand how the world works. I'm applying that knowledge as I build Venturemark.

I'm building a startup called Venturemark. It is a knowledge management system for startups that behaves a bit like a social network.

Venturemark will accelerate human progress by making good communication easier.

I spend a lot of time thinking about:

- How to make venture progress transparent, comparable, and collaborative.
- How to empower networks to add value in scalable ways.
- How to better represent identity and reputation.
