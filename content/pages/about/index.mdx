I'm passionate about building engaged, authentic relationships.

I'm building Breadcrumb to make it easier to engage business networks.

Interests include designing the ideal life, scaling meaningful impact.

I spend a lot of time thinking about:

- How to scale meaningful business relationshops
- How to better represent identity and reputation.
- How to make progress transparent, comparable, and collaborative.
- Deconstruction and reconstructing information
