Founder @ breadcrumb.so making it easier to scale business network communication.

I'm passionate about building real relationships.

I spend a lot of time thinking about:
- How to scale meaningful business relationships
- How to capture identity and reputation.
- How to make progress transparent, comparable, and collaborative.
- Deconstructing and reconstructing information
