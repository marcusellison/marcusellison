[Intentional designer](https://thinking.marcusellison.com/intentional-product-experience). Unintentional coder.

I'm on a journey. I am searching for fundamental truths that can help me understand how the world works.

I'm building a startup called Venturemark. It helps founders engage investors and advisors.

I spend a lot of time thinking about:

- How to make venture progress transparent, comparable, and collaborative.
- How to empower networks to add value in scalable ways.
- How to better represent identity and reputation.
